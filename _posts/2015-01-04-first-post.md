This is just an obligatory first post, which is also doubling as a test that this blog setup is all hunky dory.

As usual, am using [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) for my hosting. Great service, with great customer support.
About 99% of the time something goes wrong it's because I did something silly - and they are **way more** polite than I would be with the questions I ask :P

Stay tuned for some updates on some of the things I am working on in the next few months, including but not limited to:

- Optimising content blocker setups built around the `WKContentRuleList` iOS provides
- Looking at introducing Javascript (oh the sweet horror) to help get some stats on trackers being blocked etc
- Re-designing email and browser featurs to focus on readability and usability
- Discussing concepts from atomic design and how they can help bridge the communication gap between design and development
- Core DI concepts
- lots more fun stuff really

Am proper swamped with work, but hoping this will be an outlet to help clear my mind and keep my sanity :D
