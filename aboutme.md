My name is Gary Host (get it). I have been developing for iOS since 2008/2009 (back when it was called iPhoneOS). I push for well architected and test-focused solutions both at work, and in my own projects. I'm not using this site as a portfolio, so I won't go and list the places i've been and the projects I've worked on in the past - this is a place for general ranting, samples, and current projects etc

I currently work for [Anonyome Labs](https://anonyome.com)

### My Info

If you ever want to get in touch, I use [MySudo](https://mysudo.com)

If you don't already use this app I would suggest checking it out. Am a tad bias seeing I currently work there, but TLDR; is that we offer end-to-end encrypted email, messaging, voice/video calling and a compartmentalised browser. Nearly at the point where we can work on polishing the UI and general experience so watch this space.

My deets for this are:

**Email:** [g.host@sudomail.com](g.host@sudomail.com)

**Messages:** If you contact me through email we can connect using MySudo messages. It may be a discardable number but I am not that silly :P

**Slack:** Am holding off making a slack setups for now - but feel free to send me some existing workspaces and can jump in for a chat.
